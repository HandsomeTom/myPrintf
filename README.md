# ft_printf
Recreating the standard C printf function using only write, malloc and free.

# About
This is usually considered the first "big" project of the Hive Helsinki code school
(and it's sister schools, like 42 Silicon Valley or Ecole 42). The goal of this
project is to re-create printf, but more importantly it's about learning to organize
your code. School norme dictates that functions can only have 25 lines of code,
no init-assignment on the same line, max 80 characters per line and no for/switch/do
-loops, to name a few.

I'm using resources from my /libft/ which includes 54 re-created functions from C
standard library libc, following the same norme as above.
